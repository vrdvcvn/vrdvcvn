Aside from learning **Mathematics, Logic, Statistics, Algorithms, Data Structures, Data Analysis, Visual Analytics, Supervised/Unsupervised Machine Learning Technuqies, Reinforcement Learning** at university I am also improving myself by learning **Computer Vision, Model Context Protocol(MCP), Prompt Engineering, and AI Agents.**

I am proficient at **Python** I know libraries; Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, **OpenCV**, **Gradio**, etc.. I worked with **SQL, DBeaver, AWS Lambda, AWS Relational Database Service, and API's** before. I like having my home server and making automations on it too.
